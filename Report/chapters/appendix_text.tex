\chapter{Derivative of the Contrast Metric}\label{sec:jacobian}
Since we use bilinear voting to evaluate the \textit{dirac delta}, the
derivative of the cost function can be analytically computed.

However, a general nonlinear optimization is usually very hard,
especially at bundle adjustment stage he jacobian matrix only measures
the local grad
