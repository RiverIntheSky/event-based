\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract} Event cameras are
bio-inspired cameras that capture pixel-level intensity changes at a
rate of up to \SI{1}{\mega\hertz}. They naturally respond to edges in
the scene and are free from motion blur.

We propose a method which performs SLAM in planar scenes and 6-DoF
motion estimation in unstructured scenes with a monocular event
camera, no additional sensing. This method is based on a contrast
maximization pipeline. Events are grouped by a small temporal window
and warped with the optimal motion parameters that produce the
sharpest image. When performing SLAM, all the images are tracked using
image-to-model alignment, but only a selective set of keyframes are
used to construct the map. This method performs favorably against the
ground truth, and is able to track high speed motions.
